# Fedora Installation script

The intention of this script is to get you up and running as quickly as possible
after a fresh installation of [Fedora Workstation](https://www.fedoraproject.org/workstation/).

## Steps to use

clone this repo and cd into the directory, then

```
chmod +x restore
```

Add the script to your path and run it from your home directory. You can
substitute your own dotfiles for mine and have a system ready to roll to your
specification. 

Enjoy.
